## üéØ **KEY INSIGHTS & FINDINGS**

### **üèÜ Best Performing Combinations:**
1. **EfficientNet features consistently win** - Top 2 models both use EfficientNet
2. **XGBoost slightly edges SVM** on EfficientNet (78.81% vs 78.55%)
3. **ResNet50 + SVM** shows excellent balanced performance (3rd place)

### **üìà Feature Extractor Rankings:**
1. **ü•á EfficientNet**: 78.81% & 78.55% (consistent excellence)
2. **ü•à ResNet50**: 74.42% & 71.06% (solid performance)
3. **ü•â YOLOv8n**: 64.86% & 46.51% (inconsistent, SVM much better)
4. **LayoutXLM**: 54.01% & 50.13% (underperforming for document images)

### **ü§ñ Algorithm Performance:**
- **XGBoost**: Better generalization, less overfitting on complex features
- **SVM**: Fast training, excellent with strong features (EfficientNet/ResNet50)
- **Direct CNN**: Surprisingly competitive without pre-trained features

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Observations:**
- **Severe overfitting** in most models (train acc 95-100% vs test 46-78%)
- **YOLOv8n + SVM**: Extreme precision (95%) but terrible recall (31%) 
- **LayoutXLM disappointing**: Despite being document-focused, performs poorly
- **CNN baseline**: Low overfitting suggests room for improvement

### **üîß Best Hyperparameters:**
- **Learning Rate**: 0.2 for best models
- **Max Depth**: 3-6 (shallow trees work best)
- **Estimators**: 100-200 range optimal
- **Regularization**: Minimal (reg_alpha=0, reg_lambda=1)

## üöÄ **RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **For Production:**
1. **Deploy XGBoost + EfficientNet** (78.81% accuracy, best overall)
2. **Backup: SVM + EfficientNet** (78.55% accuracy, faster inference)

### **For Future Research:**
1. **Address overfitting**: Add data augmentation, dropout, early stopping
2. **Ensemble methods**: Combine top 3 models for potential 80%+ accuracy
3. **Fine-tune CNN**: The baseline shows promise with proper regularization
4. **Investigate LayoutXLM**: Poor performance needs analysis

### **Data Insights:**
- **Dataset size**: 771 train, 387 test samples
- **Feature dimensions**: 256-2048 (EfficientNet 1280 optimal)
- **Training time**: 10-27 minutes per experiment
